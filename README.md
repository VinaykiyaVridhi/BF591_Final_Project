The RShiny app, is a web-based tool that allows users to perform various bioinformatics tasks without the need for specialized programming knowledge. The app is built using the R programming language and the Shiny package, which allows for the creation of interactive web applications directly from R code. The app typically includes modules for tasks such as data preprocessing, visualization, statistical analysis, etc. Users can upload their data files or use publicly available datasets, and then select from a range of analysis options to explore their data.

This dataset profiled gene expression with RNASeq in post-mortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from patients who died from Huntingtonâ€™s Disease and age- and sex-matched neurologically healthy controls. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26636579/
The sample data I used was data from tables 1 and 2 from the paper.
The counts data was provided with the paper, since its a large file I have uploaded it as a zip.
The expression data I used was from table 3 in the paper.
