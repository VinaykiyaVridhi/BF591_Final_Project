# BF591_Final_Project
This dataset profiled gene expression with RNASeq in post-mortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from patients who died from Huntingtonâ€™s Disease and age- and sex-matched neurologically healthy controls. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26636579/
The sample data I used was data from tables 1 and 2 from the paper.
The counts data was provided with the paper, since its a large file I have uploaded it as a zip.
The expression data I used was from table 3 in the paper.
